# How memory works

Your computer looks like a giant set of drawers, and each drawer has an address
`f30ffeeb` is the address of a slot in memory. Each time you want to store an item in memory, you ask the computer for some space, and it gives you an address where you can store your item. If you want store multiple items, there are two basic ways to do so: `arrays` and `lists`. There isn't one right way to store items for every use case, so it's important to know the differences.
