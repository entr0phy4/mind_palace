# Fundamentals

## Big O Notation {{ id: 'big-o-notation' }}

Big O is special notation that tells you how fas an algorithm is. It tells you how fast the algorithm grows. This lets you compare the number of operations. {{ className: 'lead' }}

What's the running time in Big O notation? It's O(log n). In general, Big O notation is written as O(f(n)), where f(n) is the function that describes the running time or number of operations.

<Note>
It's called Big O notation because you put a "Big O" in front of the number of operations (sounds like a joke, but it's true!)
</Note>

### Some common Big O run times

- `O(n)` - Linear time, E.g Simple/Linear search
- `O(log n)` - Logarithmic time, E.g. Binary search
- `O(n * log n)` - A fast sorting algorithm: Example: Quick sort
- `O(n^2)` - A slow sorting algorithm, E.g selection sort
- `O(n!)` - A really slow algorithm, E.g. Travelling Salesman

## Logarithms

If you not remember what logarithms are, but you know what exponential are.

log<sub>10</sub>100 is like asking, "How many 10s do we multiply to get 100?"
The anwser is 2, because 10 * 10 = 100. So log<sub>10</sub>100 = 2.

<Note>
    Logs are the flip of exponentials.
