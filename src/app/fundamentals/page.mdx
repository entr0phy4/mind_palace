## Big O Notation

<Note>
It's called Big O notation because you put a "Big O" in front of the number of operations (sounds like a joke, but it's true!)
</Note>

It tells you how fast the algorithm grows. Big O notation lets you compare the number of operations.  {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Logarithms

If you not remember what logarithms are, but you know what exponential are.

log<sub>10</sub>100 is like asking, "How many 10s do we multiply to get 100?"
The anwser is 2, because 10 * 10 = 100. So log<sub>10</sub>100 = 2.

<Note>
    Logs are the flip of exponentials.
