### What's computer hardware?

Simple definition of a computer hardware is: <i>"any physical parts or components that contribute to a computer system."</i>

There are several different kinds of hardware inside a PC. Both desktop and laptop PCs include these types of hardware, though the size and type differ because of laptop's compact design.

### What's a motherboard?

Your computer's motherboard is the hub that connect all the other pieces of computer hardware, acting as the brain to allocate and coordinate power across all the components.
The motherboard determines which other hardware components can be used with your computer, such as storage devices.

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)

CPU stands for central processing unit, and it's responsible for guiding your computer as it processes data, much like a brain guides a body. That's the core computational utin in a server. Servers and other smart devices convert data into digital signals and perform mathematical operations on them. The CPU processes the signals and makes computing possible. This Brain fetches instructions from memory, performs the required tasks, and sends output back to memory. It handles all computing tasks required for runnign the operating system and applicacions.

The speed at which is does this is known as 'clock speed', and is measured in gigahertz (GHz). A CPU advertising a high GHz rating will likely perform faster that others from the same brand and generation.

<Note>
    ### How did CPU technology advance over time?
    the earliest computers used vacuum tubes for processing. Machines like the ENIAC and UNIVAC were large and bulky, and they consumed a lot of power generated significant heat. The invention of transistors in the late 1940s revolutionized CPU technology

### Microprocessors {{ id: 'microprocessors' }}

Microprocessors combined the entire CPU on a single integrated circuit chip, which made computers more accessible and led to the development of personal computers. Initially, CPUs could handle 16 to 32 bits of data at a time. In the early 2000s, 64-bit CPUs emerged, which allowed for larger memory addressing and supported more extensive data processing.

### What are the components of a CPU?

A CPU is a complex electronic circuit that comprises several key componennts that process data and run instructions. The main components of a CPU are given next

<b>Control Unit</b>

 The control unit manages instructions processing and coordinates data flow within the CPU and between other computer componennts. It has an instruction decoder component that interprets the instructions fetched from memory and converts them into micro-operations that the CPU can run. The control unit directs other CPU components to perform required operations.

<b>Registers</b>

 Registers are small, high-speed memory storage locations within the CPU. They hold data that the cpu is currently working on and facilitate quick access to data. CPUs have several types of registers, like these:

 - General-purpose registers that hold operational data
 - Instruction registers that hold that current instruction being processed
 - A program counter that holds the memory address of the next instruction to be fetched

Registers provide faster access times that other memory levels like RAM or cache memory.

<b>ALU</b>

The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, substraction, multiplication, and division) and logical operations (AND, OR and NOT) ON DATA. It receives data from registers within the CPU, processes it basesd on the instructions from the control unit, and produces the result.

<b>Memory management unit</b>

Depending on the CPU architecture, there might be a separate bus interface unit or memory management unit. These components handle memory-related tasks, such as managing the CPU and RAM interaction. it also handles cache memory, a small and fast memory unit located within the CPU and virtual memory that the CPU requires for data processing.

<b>Clock</b>

The CPU relies on a clock signal to synchronize its internal operations. The clock generates a steady pulse at a specific frequency, and these clock cycles coordinate the CPU's operations. The clock speed is measured in hertz (Hz) and determines how many instructions the CPU can executed per second. Mondern CPUs have variable clock speeds, which adjust based on workload to balance performance and power consumption.

### Transistor {{ id: 'transitor' }}

A transistor is a semiconductor device used to aplify or switch electrical signals and power. It is one of the basic building blocks of modern electronics. It's composed of semiconductor material, usually with at least three terminal for connection to and electric circuit. A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can be higher that the controlling (input) power, a transistor ca amplify a signal. Some transistors are packaged individually, but many more in minuature form are found embedded in integrated circuits.

### Random Access Memory (RAM)

Computer RAM works closely with the CPU and temporarily stores information created by programs so that it's immediately accessible. it's sometimes referred to as 'volatile' memory because this data gets erased every time your computer restarts.

RAM plays a vital part in many tasks, including rendering images for graphic design, editing videos or photographs, and multitasking with several apps or programs open.
