# Array and Linked lists

Sometimes you need to store a list of elements in memory. There are two common ways to do this: arrays and linked lists. Should you use an array, or a linked list? {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Array {{ id: 'arrays' }}

### What's Array in Data structure?

An array is a data structure for storing more than one data item that has a similar data type.
Using an array means all your items are stored contiguosly in memory (right next to each other).
The details of an array are accessed about its position. This reference is called `index` or `subscript`.

So, an array is a container of elements. Elements have a specific value and data type, like "ABC", TRUE or FALSE, etc.

<Note>
    - Arrays provide random access.
    - An index is always less than the total numbers of array items.
    - In terms of syntax, any variable that is declared as an array can store multiple values.
    - Almost all languages have the same comprehension of arrays but have differents ways of declaring and initializing them.
    - Howeber, three parts will always remain common in all the initializations, i.e., array name, elements and the data type of elements.
</Note>

### Why do we need arrays?

good reasons are:

<p>
- [x] Arrays are the best for storing multiple values in a single variable
- [x] Arrays are better at processing many values easily and quickly
- [x] Sorting and searching the values is easier in arrays
</p>

### Pros:

- You know the address for every item in your array.
- Arrays are great if you want to read random elements.

### Cons:
- You may not need the extras slots that you asked for, and the that memory will be wasted. You aren't using it, but no one else can use it either.
- You may add more than 10 items yo your task list and have to move anyway.

### Run times for common operations
- <Heading level={4} tag='O(1)' label='Access'></Heading>
- <Heading level={4} tag='O(1)' label='Reading'></Heading>
- <Heading level={4} tag='O(n)' label='Insertion'></Heading>
- <Heading level={4} tag='O(n)' label='Deletion'></Heading>

## Linked lists {{ id: 'linked-lists' }}

With linked lists, your items can be anywhere in memory. Each item stores the address of the next sitem in the list. A bunch of random memory addresses are linked together. Adding an item to a linked list is easy: you stick it anywhere in memory and store the address with the previous item.

### Run times for common operations
- <Heading level={4} tag='O(n)' label='Reading'></Heading>
- <Heading level={4} tag='O(1)' label='Insertion'></Heading>
- <Heading level={4} tag='O(1)' label='Deletion'></Heading>


Linked lists have a evident problem. Suppose you want to read the last item in a linked list, You can't just read it, because you don't know what address it's at. Instead, you have to go to item #1 to get the address for item #2, then go to item #2 to get the address for item #3, and so on, until you reach the last item.

Linked list only do sequential access.

### Pros:
- Your items can be anywhere in memory.
- Adding an item to linked list is easy.
- If there's space in memory, you have space for your linked list.
- Linked lists are great if you're going to read all the items on at a time.

### Cons:
- You never have to move your items.
- If you're going to keep jumping around, linked lists are terrible.

### Terminology

The elements in an array are numbered. This nubmering starts from 0, not 1.
The position of an element is called its `index`. So instead of saying "the first element of the array", we say "the element at `index 0`".
