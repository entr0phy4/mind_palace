# Array and Linked lists

## Array {{ id: 'arrays' }}

### Terminology

The elements in an array are numbered. This nubmering starts from 0, not 1.
The position of an element is called its `index`. So instead of saying "the first element of the array", we say "the element at `index 0`".

## Linked lists {{ id: 'linked-lists' }}

With linked lists, your items can be anywhere in memory. Each item stores the address of the next sitem in the list. A bunch of random memory addresses are linked together. Adding an item to a linked list is easy: you stick it anywhere in memory and store the address with the previous item.
