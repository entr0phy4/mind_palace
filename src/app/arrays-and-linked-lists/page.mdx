# Array and Linked lists

Sometimes you need to store a list of elements in memory. There are two common ways to do this: arrays and linked lists. Should you use an array, or a linked list? {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Array {{ id: 'arrays' }}

Using an array means all your items are stored contiguosly in memory (right next to each other).

### Run times for common operations
- <Heading level={4} tag='O(1)' label='Reading'></Heading>
- <Heading level={4} tag='O(n)' label='Insertion'></Heading>
- <Heading level={4} tag='O(n)' label='Deletion'></Heading>

Arrays provide random access.

### Pros:
- You know the address for every item in your array.
- Arrays are great if you want to read random elements.

### Cons:
- You may not need the extras slots that you asked for, and the that memory will be wasted. You aren't using it, but no one else can use it either.
- You may add more than 10 items yo your task list and have to move anyway.

## Linked lists {{ id: 'linked-lists' }}

With linked lists, your items can be anywhere in memory. Each item stores the address of the next sitem in the list. A bunch of random memory addresses are linked together. Adding an item to a linked list is easy: you stick it anywhere in memory and store the address with the previous item.

### Run times for common operations
- <Heading level={4} tag='O(n)' label='Reading'></Heading>
- <Heading level={4} tag='O(1)' label='Insertion'></Heading>
- <Heading level={4} tag='O(1)' label='Deletion'></Heading>


Linked lists have a evident problem. Suppose you want to read the last item in a linked list, You can't just read it, because you don't know what address it's at. Instead, you have to go to item #1 to get the address for item #2, then go to item #2 to get the address for item #3, and so on, until you reach the last item.

Linked list only do sequential access.

### Pros:
- Your items can be anywhere in memory.
- Adding an item to linked list is easy.
- If there's space in memory, you have space for your linked list.
- Linked lists are great if you're going to read all the items on at a time.

### Cons:
- You never have to move your items.
- If you're going to keep jumping around, linked lists are terrible.

### Terminology

The elements in an array are numbered. This nubmering starts from 0, not 1.
The position of an element is called its `index`. So instead of saying "the first element of the array", we say "the element at `index 0`".
